# rock-paper-scissors
Game of rock paper scissors. Odin project

This is a simple Javascript implementation of the game Rock, Paper, Scissors.
The user will go against the computer. Where the computer will randomly choose one of the three options, the user will be prompted to enter rock, paper or scissors. The two answers will be evaluated against each other to determine the winner.

For now the game will be played from the browser console. The intention is to get the game mechanics working first. A GUI will be added at a later date.
